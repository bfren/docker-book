# Home

This started out as a project to learn Docker and have control over the versions of the various pieces of FOSS I use. But I hope you find the ecosystem as useful as I do!

The instructions assume a working knowledge of shell programming, Docker, and Docker Compose.  Like most documentation they are also a work in progress...
